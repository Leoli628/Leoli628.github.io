How to publish this as a GitHub Pages academic webpage

1) Find your GitHub username (handle):
   - Go to your profile page: https://github.com/USERNAME
   - The part after github.com/ is your USERNAME.

2) Create a repository named exactly:
   USERNAME.github.io   (must match your username)

3) Upload these files to the repository root:
   - index.html
   - paper_isbi2026.pdf  (optional, included if you provided it)

4) In the repo: Settings -> Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main (root)

5) Your public link will be:
   https://USERNAME.github.io/

Fill the form item with that link:
"Google Scholar Link or URL of your academic webpage with a list of your publications."
