How to publish this as a GitHub Pages academic webpage

1) Create a GitHub repository named exactly:
   YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io

2) Upload these files to the repository root:
   - index.html
   - paper.pdf  (optional but included)

3) In the repo: Settings -> Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main (root)

4) Your public link will be:
   https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/

Use that link to fill the form item:
"Google Scholar Link or URL of your academic webpage with a list of your publications."
